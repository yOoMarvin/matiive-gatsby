            and premium coffee machine.

            damage is still covered by our household and contents insurance. We
            replace the your damaged goods - and that for the new value!

            During a weekend excursion, burglars go about their business in your
            home. To get into the apartment, they break up the apartment door
            and damage it considerably. They bring along various electronic
            devices and valuables.

            Due to a technical defect, an electric appliance in the living room
            develops a little fire, which quickly expands into a really
            dangerous fire. Until the fire department can extinguish the fire, a
            large part of the living room furniture is burned out or irreparably
            damaged by the extinguishing water. In the other rooms items have
            been damaged by the soot.
